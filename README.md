Implement a hardware-accelerated Logistic Regression Machine Learning (ML) model to address real-time decision-making in sensor-based applications where rapid and accurate classification of incoming data is crucial for effective operation. Synthesize the data to create a dataset representative of typical conditions that the system would encounter in a real-world environment. The data can include features such as   temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements to mimic the real-world data. The Logistic Regression ML Model should leverage this dataset to predict binary outcomes such as whether environmental conditions exceed predefined thresholds or not. Consider hardcoded weights and biases to simplify the implementation for this prototype.
“Use the ARM SoC to handle software tasks, such as data processing, control logic, or communication interfaces. Utilize the Programmable Logic (PL) part of the FPGA to implement hardware accelerators, custom peripherals, or real-time processing tasks. Incorporate Block RAM (BRAM) for storing data that needs fast access, such as buffers for signal processing or look-up tables. Use other FPGA components as needed, such as DSP slices for mathematical operations, or GPIOs for interfacing with external devices.
Develop the software in C/C++ or other appropriate languages, targeting the ARM Cortex cores within the SoC. The software should manage the overall system, including initiating hardware tasks in the PL, processing data, and handling communication protocols. Integrate the hardware and software components, ensuring that they work together seamlessly. This may involve setting up communication between the ARM processor and the FPGA fabric using AXI interfaces.”
